[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)                 
[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)   



## Usage:-

- Clone my repository.
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run following command.


  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

----The above command will install all the libraries that are required in this python file. We then import from this.

- `Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py` is the main Python file of Streamlit Web-Application. 

'''
pip install streamlit
'''

- `Fruit_Veg_Classification_Mobilenet.ipynb` is the Notebook file of the Training

- Dataset that I have used is [Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition).
- To run app, write following command in CMD. or use any IDE.

  ```
  streamlit run Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py
  ```


With the help of the streamlit we can host our project on the browser. Thus the working of the project is implemented.

NOTE -
In this project we have used python 3.6 version, but please avoid using other higher versions of python. because in this project, we have used tensorflow 2.6.0, which is not available in the higher versions from 3.8 to 3.10 (tensorflow 2.2).
